                        Hi my name is Xavier Royer! I’m currently a freshman at Cal Poly Slo, majoring in physics with a plan to minor in computer science.
                        I really love <strong>problem solving</strong> and <strong>creating projects</strong>, 
                        whether that’s <strong>optimizing</strong> the mechanics of a catapult, 
                        <strong>creating</strong> a game, <strong>building</strong> robots for competitions, 
                        or <strong>calculating</strong> the moment of inertia of a Reuleaux tetrahedron. 
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Beyond investigating projects in the STEM fields I also love 
                        <strong>mountain running</strong>, <strong>basketball</strong>, <strong>spikeball</strong>, analyzing <strong>literature</strong>, 
                        and pretty much everything that's outdoors or involves critical thinking. 
                        Some of my favorite books include <em>The Stranger</em>, <em>Perfume</em>, and <em>The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea</em>. 
                        As for running, I’m currently trying to set the record for the fastest completion of the tri-tip challenge!
