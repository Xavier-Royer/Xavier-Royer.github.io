                                It's currently in beta release for both the apple and play store. It was developed using the Godot engine, and github for version control.</p>

The development proccess included a full product life cycle including extensive planning documents (UML, flowcharts, GUI sketches, success criteria) as well as a prototype and maintenance phase. It also included client feedback in an agile style development cycle to suit the client's needs.</p>

                            <p>I researched and wrote a paper on catapult opimziation for my VEX Robotic's team's robot. It focused on finding the optimal motor load to produce the greatest projectile distance per reload time, as well as finding the right moment of inertia of the arm to produce a collision with peak energy conservation. At then end, the catapult was able to shoot around 70% further.</p>

                            <p>This robot used a vision sensor and a PID loop to scan an area for where game-objects were located and then drive up and capture them. The vision sensor acted as a feedback system which made the autonomous routes more accurate than when simply hard coding the location of the objects.</p>
